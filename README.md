# sitOnChair

===============

This repo includes the code of the PSD-to-website exercise at Coders Labs JavaScript Dev (React) bootcamp.

Important comment: the website is not responsive, the exercise didn't include it. RWD topic came up later through the course.

Directories structure:
1. -css (CSS code compiled from Sass)
2. -img (images)
3. -js (JavaScript code)
4. -sass (.scss files)
5. gulpfile.js (Gulp config file)
6. index.html
